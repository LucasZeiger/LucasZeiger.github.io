    I am a scientist dedicated to unraveling the complexities of <strong className="text-white">colorectal cancer</strong> through the lens of spatial transcriptomics. 
    My work bridges the gap between molecular biology and computational analysis, aiming to understand the tumor microenvironment's architecture and its influence on disease progression and therapeutic resistance. 
    <br /><br />
    By preserving spatial context, we can decipher cell-cell communications that single-cell sequencing alone might miss. My goal is to translate these spatial insights into actionable therapeutic targets.
