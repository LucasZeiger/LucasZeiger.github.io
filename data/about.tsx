    My background is in molecular medicine and disease modelling. 
    My current work bridges the gap between molecular and computational biology, aiming to understand fundamental and tumour biology through the lense of spatial -omics methods. 
    Based at the CRUK Scotland Institute in Glasgow, Scotland, I work with excellent people in the multidisciplinary computational biology group, led by Prof. Crispin Miller.
