# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `index.tsx` boots the React app and mounts `App.tsx`.
- `App.tsx` wires routing and global layout.
- `components/` holds reusable UI building blocks (PascalCase files like `Navbar.tsx`).
- `pages/` contains route-level views (e.g., `Home.tsx`, `ResearchDetail.tsx`).
- `data/` stores content and datasets (TypeScript exports plus `orcid-publications.json`).
- `public/` hosts static assets copied as-is by Vite.
- `scripts/` contains maintenance utilities (e.g., ORCID sync).
- `dist/` is build output (generated; do not edit by hand).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies.
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server for local work.
- `npm run build` creates a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.
- `npm run fetch:orcid` refreshes `data/orcid-publications.json` from ORCID.
- `npm run deploy` publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages (runs `build` first).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React with Vite; keep JSX in `.tsx` files.
- Follow the existing style: 2-space indentation, semicolons, single quotes.
- Components and routes use PascalCase file names (`ResearchCard.tsx`).
- Functions/variables use `camelCase`; constants use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` when appropriate.
- No formatter or linter is configured; keep changes consistent with nearby code.

## Testing Guidelines
- There is no automated test framework configured.
- For validation, run `npm run dev` for UI checks and `npm run build` to ensure the bundle compiles.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use short, lowercase verb phrases (e.g., "add workflow status badges").
- Keep commits focused; avoid mixing content updates with tooling changes.
- For PRs, include a brief summary and screenshots for UI changes; link related issues when available.

## Configuration Tips
- `metadata.json` and `data/*.tsx` drive site content; prefer editing those over hardcoding.
- `data/orcid-publications.json` is generated by `fetch:orcid`; avoid manual edits.
